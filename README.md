I really don't know much about programming so there isn't much in this program, definitely no copy paste   
though I want to get more into it eventually  
  
This program will help beginners setup [GI-Model-Importer](https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer)  
# How to use?
1. Select the d3dx.ini from the 3DMigoto folder  
2. Select your game .exe (Must be named GenshinImpact.exe, not the launcher)  
3. Click 'change'
